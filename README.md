# Creative Developing

This is a repo to allow me to practice more creative programming using  tools like GSAP, Framer Motion, Lenis etc.
It also allows me to build a directory for good learning resources relating to creative programming or development.

The main method for learning here is to find websites/techniques which I think are cool, and try to replicate them in my own way.
